<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Yue Yuan and I come from China. I am living in Närpiö,
  Finland with my husband and two boys.</p>

<p>I was studying my master's program for telecommunication engineering in
  Vaasa university(2011-2015). I have done my master's thesis which is
  about making an embedded program (sorting algorithm) by generating
  random numbers in RaspberryPI and PC, then compare those four
  algorithm's performance between Raspberry Pi and a PC. If you want to
  check more details please click <span><a href="https://osuva.uwasa.fi/handle/10024/6777">thesis link</a> </span> from Vaasa university's
  website.</p>

<p>I was suddenly pregnant at 2016 and could not find any IT related job in a
  small town called Närpiö (before the epidemiy). Then I have to start another career here and
  working as a practical nurse until now. I can communicate well in Swedish and English.</p>
  
 <p> As the time passing by, I realise I still cannot forget my passion for IT and
  it is still my dream job if I still can get a foot back into the IT field
  someday. Hope I can join to study this full stack developer program and explore new coding knowledge in recent industry world. I truly believe this would be a great re-kickstart for my career.</p>
